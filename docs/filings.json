This proposed update introduces a new routine use to comply with Executive Order (E.O.) 14249, Protecting America's Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse. The change supports enhanced efforts to safeguard federal financial systems and ensure responsible stewardship of public funds. The modified SORN does not change the categories of individuals, the record collection process, the authorities, or the purpose of collection. It also does not affect individuals' rights to access or amend their records under the Privacy Act.",
